# Balatro Safety (Steamodded)
This is a mod for Balatro which presents a confirmation window when you take potentially game-ruining actions. Balatro has no rewind feature, and when you're playing hands for hours at a time, it's easy to make a mistake. A simple mistake shouldn't cost you a good run.
